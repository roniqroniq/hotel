		<h2>Botovets. We are opening a brand new hotel in this winter resort for season 2019!</h2>
		<br>
		<p>Borovets is the oldest Bulgarian winter resort with a history that dates back to 1896. Borovets was originally
		established at the end of the 19th Century as a hunting place for the Bulgarian Kings. Borovets gradually developed
		into a modern ski resort with hotels, restaurants, bars and a network of ski runs and lifts along the slopes of the
		Rila Mountains, providing for a whole range of winter sports. The resort has twice hosted World Cup Alpine Skiing 
		rounds(1981 and 1984), while the Biathlon track is one of the best in the world. </p>
